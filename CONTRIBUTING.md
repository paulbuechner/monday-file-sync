When it comes to open source, there are different ways you can contribute, all
of which are valuable. Here's a few guidelines that should help you as you
prepare your contribution.

## Setup the Project

The following steps will get you up and running to contribute to Monday File Sync:

1. Fork the repo (click the <kbd>Fork</kbd> button at the top right of
   [this page](https://github.com/paulbuechner/monday-file-sync))

2. Clone your fork locally

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/monday-file-sync.git
cd monday-file-sync
```

3. Setup all the dependencies and packages by running `npm install`. This command will install dependencies.

### Commands

**`npm install`**: install global dependencies.

For more information about available commands visit the respective package README.

## Think you found a bug?

Please conform to the issue template and provide a clear path to reproduction with a code example. The best way to show a bug is by sending a CodeSandbox link.

## Making a Pull Request?

Pull requests need only the :+1: of two or more collaborators to be merged; when the PR author is a collaborator, that counts as one.

### Commit Convention

Before you create a Pull Request, please check whether your commits comply with the commit conventions used in this repository.

When you create a commit we kindly ask you to follow the convention
`category(scope or module): message` in your commit message while using one of
the following categories:

- `feat / feature`: all changes that introduce completely new code or new features
- `fix`: changes that fix a bug (ideally you will additionally reference an issue if present)
- `refactor`: any code related change that is not a fix nor a feature
- `docs`: changing existing or creating new documentation (i.e. README, docs for usage of a lib or cli usage)
- `build`: all changes regarding the build of the software, changes to dependencies or the addition of new dependencies
- `test`: all changes regarding tests (adding new tests or changing existing ones)
- `ci`: all changes regarding the configuration of continuous integration (i.e. github actions, ci system)
- `story`: all changes that introduce new or edited storybook components
- `chore`: all changes to the repository that do not fit into any of the above categories

If you are interested in the detailed specification you can visit
https://www.conventionalcommits.org/ or check out the
[Angular Commit Message Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines).

### Steps to PR

1. Fork of the paulbuechner/portfolio repository and clone your fork

2. Create a new branch out of the `main` branch. We follow the convention
   `[type/scope]`. For example `fix/notification` or `docs/readme`. `type`
   can be either `docs`, `fix`, `feat`, `build`, or any other conventional
   commit type. `scope` is just a short id that describes the scope of work.

3. Make and commit your changes following the
   [commit convention](https://github.com/paulbuechner/monday-file-sync/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-convention).
